# Modelling-5-7-Ring-Dislocations-in-InGaN-Using-CONQUEST-Density-Functional-Theory-Code
CMMP Summer Research Project 2022

This summer project aims to determine the most energetically favourable positions of In atoms in various GaN 5-7 ring dislocations using CONQUEST Density Functional Theory code. The project was completed under the supervision of Prof David Bowler at the London Centre for Nanotechnology between June and Septeber 2022.
