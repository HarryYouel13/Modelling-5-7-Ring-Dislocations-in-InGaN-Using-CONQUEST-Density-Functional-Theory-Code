# Modelling-5-7-Ring-Dislocations-in-InGaN-Using-CONQUEST-Density-Functional-Theory-Code
Condensed Matter & Materials Physics Summer Research Project 2022 (UCL/LCN)

This summer project aims to determine the most energetically favourable positions of In atoms in various GaN 5/7 ring dislocations using CONQUEST Density Functional Theory code. The project was completed under the supervision of Prof David Bowler at the London Centre for Nanotechnology between June and Septeber 2022. My formal report can be accessed under 'Modelling 5/7 Ring Dislocations in InGaN Using CONQUEST DFT Code' and the coordinate files and DFT calculations used to create the various dislocation plots can be found under Supplementary Files.
